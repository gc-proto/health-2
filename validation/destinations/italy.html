			<summary>Safety and security</summary>
			<h2>Safety and security</h2>
			<h3>Crime</h3><p>The level of street crime in Italy is comparable to that of other European countries, particularly in large urban centres. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occur at tourist sites, on public transportation and at major airports and railway stations. Foreigners are targeted. If possible, avoid carrying handbags. Motorcyclists frequently grab bags and other personal belongings from pedestrians, often resulting in injury to the robbery victim. There have also been reports of thefts of unattended belongings at beaches.</p><p>Exercise caution and be alert while travelling by road and rail; foreigners are often targeted by criminals. Theft of items from vehicles is common, and can occur at gas stations and service areas along the highway, as well as in parking lots. Be especially vigilant when stopped at traffic lights, as bags are often snatched from passenger seats by thieves travelling on scooters or on foot. Keep your windows closed, bags and handbags out of reach, and car doors locked at all times. Never leave personal belongings unattended in a vehicle, and use secure parking facilities, especially overnight. Train passengers have been robbed while distracted or sleeping, and there have been reports of thefts on the train connecting Fiumicino airport to central Rome. Thefts on public transit (buses, subway and trams, particularly those servicing major tourist sites) are common, with thieves often hassling or crowding their victims. Keep your valuables secure and out of sight.
      </p>

      <p>Thieves often work in pairs or groups and will attempt to distract the victim while their accomplices rob them. Be particularly careful of offers to help with flat tires or if someone spills food or a beverage on you; these are common ploys used by groups of thieves. The number of lost and stolen passports increases during the summer months. To prevent loss or theft, exercise caution and carry a photocopy of your passport, rather than the original.</p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances, as they may have drugged the item to put you at risk of assault and robbery. Incidents of this sort have occurred even in small towns known to be frequented by tourists.</p><p>Rail passengers have received drugged food or drink and were then robbed or assaulted while sleeping. Keep your compartment door securely locked.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time and could target areas frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers, such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels, schools, places of worship and airports and other transportation hubs. Exercise caution if attending sporting events, religious holiday celebrations and other public festivities. Remain vigilant at all times, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.</p><p>Following the November 13, 2015, attacks in Paris, the Government of Italy raised the national terror alert level to two. Expect enhanced security measures as well as an increase in police and armed forces presence, particularly at airports, large events and major landmarks.</p><h3>Demonstrations and strikes</h3><p>Demonstrations and protests occur regularly, particularly in larger cities and often with little notice. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><p>Transportation strikes are also common and affect travel by air, rail and public transportation services. Plan on having to make alternate travel arrangements and regularly check with transportation providers for any schedule changes. See the Italian <a href="http://scioperi.mit.gov.it/mit2/public/scioperi">Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport</a> (in Italian, only) for information on planned strike action.</p><p>Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings, as they have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Monitor local news and follow the advice of local authorities.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Fraudulent electronic readout devices are sometimes used at automated banking machines (ABMs) in Italy. These devices are designed to capture the account information stored on the card&rsquo;s magnetic strip through a card reader fixed over the legitimate reader. The customer&rsquo;s PIN is recorded with a small video camera installed above the keypad. The victim&rsquo;s banking information is then sold or traded online. To avoid being a victim of this fraud, use ABMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business, avoid card readers with an irregular aspect, cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN and check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/issues_enjeux/article-eng.asp?id=1090">Overseas fraud</a>&nbsp;for more information on scams abroad.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. City streets are often narrow, winding and congested. In mountainous areas, roads are often winding and narrow and weather conditions can make driving conditions dangerous. Avalanches or landslides can occur and block access routes to small isolated towns.</p><p>Drivers do not always obey road rules and may use excessive speed and reckless manoeuvering. In cities, signage, traffic lights and road markings may be non-existent, unclear or ignored.</p><p>Pay close attention to road conditions and refrain from driving during or immediately after severe storms. Monitor local news and follow the advice and warnings issued by local authorities.</p><p>In northern Italy, be aware of the potential for ground fog and poor visibility, especially in winter.</p><p>Be cautious when using pedestrian crossings as drivers do not always stop even though they are required to by law.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Only use officially licensed taxis equipped with roof lights and meters. If you call a radio taxi, be aware that the meter starts to run as soon as the cab leaves to pick you up.</p><p>Bus, metro and tram tickets are purchased in advance (sold at kiosks in stations or at tobacco shops) and must be validated by machines located either on board or in the station. Failure to validate tickets may result in on-the-spot fines requiring immediate payment.</p><p>Rail service is widely available. Ferry services are available to Greece, North Africa and local islands (for example, Capri, Elba, Ischia, Sardinia and Sicily).</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p>Learn more <a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">about foreign domestic airlines</a>.</p><h3>Mountain activities</h3><p>If you intend to do mountaineering or skiing:</p><ul><li>never practice these activities alone;</li><li>always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company;</li><li>buy <a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/travel-insurance">travel insurance</a> that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation;</li><li>ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity;</li><li>ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard;</li><li>advise a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp;</li><li>know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal;</li><li>sign up for the <a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration">Registration of Canadians abroad service</a>;</li><li>obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes; and</li><li>Consult <a href="http://www.meteomont.gov.it/infoMeteo/index.do?inglese=true&prevValanghe=true">Meteomont</a> for information on avalanche risk.</li></ul><h3>General safety information</h3><p>Pay attention to your surroundings. Avoid showing signs of affluence and carrying large sums of cash on you.</p><p>Ensure that your personal belongings and passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.&nbsp;Never travel with your passport and proof of Canadian citizenship (birth certificate or Canadian citizenship certificate) in the same bag or pouch. Keep a photocopy of your passport in case of loss.</p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number of migrants and refugees entering Europe. Some countries have already experienced disruptions to transportation services, including at ferry ports and railway stations, and have seen major delays at border crossings. The situation also heightens the potential for demonstrations that could turn violent without warning, particularly at railway stations and other transportation hubs. If you are travelling in the region, monitor local news and follow the advice of local authorities, and contact your transport carrier to determine whether the situation could disrupt your travel.</p>

			<!-- START para1 --><p>Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination&rsquo;s entry or exit requirements.</p><p>We have obtained the information on this page from the Italian authorities. It can, however, change at any time.</p><p>Verify this information with <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng">foreign diplomatic missions and consulates in Canada</a>.</p><p>Customs officials may ask you to show them a return ticket, proof of the purpose of your visit to Italy and/or proof of sufficient funds for your stay. Having more than one source of funds (for example, cash, traveller&rsquo;s cheques, credit card, bank card) is recommended.</p><p>Canadians arriving from a Schengen area country, staying less than 90 days and not staying in commercial accommodations, must file a declaration of presence (dichiarazione di presenza) with the local police office (questura) within eight days of arrival. Commercial accommodations will generally file the declaration of presence on behalf of travellers; however, the traveller is responsible to ensure that it is done. Obtain a copy of the registration form from the hotel. Failure to comply with this regulation could result in expulsion from Italy. If arriving from a non-Schengen country, ensure that border officials place an entry stamp in your passport, as this is the equivalent to a declaration of presence. See the <a href="http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/servizi/stranieri/ingressosoggiornoinitalia/soggiorno_stranieri_in_italia.html">Italian Foreign Ministry</a> for details.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/10617/">Polizia di Stato</a> (Italy&rsquo;s national police) for additional information on entry and exit requirements.</p><!-- END para1 --><!-- START passport --><h3>Passport</h3><p>Italy is a Schengen area country.

			<h2>Natural disasters &amp; climate</h2>
			<h3>Seasonal risks</h3><p>Forest fires occur often in the summer months, including on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. In case of a major fire, stay away from affected areas, follow the advice of local emergency services personnel and monitor local media for up-to-date information. The air quality in areas near active fires may deteriorate due to heavy smoke and affect travellers with respiratory ailments.</p><p>In the fall, strong rainfall and winds often cause significant damage to roads and generate localized landslides in coastal regions (including popular tourist areas) such as Calabria, Campania (Amalfi coast), Liguria (Cinque Terre), Sicily and Tuscany. Pay close attention to road conditions and refrain from driving during or immediately after severe storms. The city of Venice is prone to flooding, particularly during periods of high water (acqua alta). Some streets and squares become impassable during these periods. Rome is subject to flash floods during periods of heavy rainfall. Monitor local news and follow the advice and warnings issued by local authorities.</p><p>In winter, avalanches and heavy snow pose a risk. They can make roads impassable and can cause power disruptions. These conditions can affect access to isolated areas, including to some tourist resorts. The conditions can also limit the ability of responders to reach these areas in case of emergency. Consult <a title="" href="http://www.meteomont.gov.it/infoMeteo/index.do?inglese=true&prevValanghe=true">Meteomont for information on avalanche risk.</a></p><h3>Seismic activity</h3><p>Italy is located in an active seismic zone. Between August 2016 and January 2017, the country was hit by 5 powerful earthquakes of magnitudes between 5.0 and 6.5. The earthquakes have caused deaths and damage to infrastructure, homes and property throughout the affected areas. On August 21, 2017, a 4.0-magnitude earthquake struck the island of Ischia, in the region of Campania in southern Italy. The earthquake caused deaths and injuries, and damage to infrastructure. Further seismic activity may occur and can trigger landslides and avalanches, as well as further damage.</p><p>Consult <a title="" href="http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/jcms/en/rischio_sismico.wp">Protezione Civile (Italy&rsquo;s civil protection department website) for information on seismic activity in the country</a> and on crises preparedness and ongoing response to recent earthquakes.</p><h3>Volcanic activity</h3><p>Mount Etna, on the island of Sicily, is Europe&rsquo;s most active volcano. If you are travelling to the area, closely monitor activity levels through local media, be aware of any risks and follow the advice of local authorities. On March 10, 2017, people were injured in an explosion of hot rock that occurred on Mount Etna.&nbsp;</p><p>Mount Stromboli, on the Island of Stromboli which is one of the Aeolian Islands is also active with regular minor eruptions and lava flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Mount Vesuvius, near Naples, is the only active volcano on the European mainland, though it has not erupted since 1944, and is continually monitored by the local authorities. There are several other dormant volcanoes throughout the country that could erupt with little warning.&nbsp;Volcanic eruptions could result in airport closures.
