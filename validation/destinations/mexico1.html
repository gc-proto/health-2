			<summary>Safety and security</summary>
			<h2>Safety and security</h2>
			<p>You are advised to sign up with the <a title="" href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration">Registration of Canadians Abroad</a> service if travelling to or residing in Mexico.</p><h3>Northern states (see <a title="" href="#risk">Advisory</a>)</h3><p>We strongly recommend travelling to Mexico by air to avoid land border crossings, particularly in the northern states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le&oacute;n, Sonora and Tamaulipas.</p><p>In northern Mexico, particularly along the border with the United States, organized crime and urban violence greatly affect security. Confrontations between organized criminal groups and Mexican authorities continue to pose a problem. Shootouts, attacks and illegal roadblocks may occur without warning. Avoid inter-city road travel in the northern states. Heavily armed gangs have attacked travelers driving through the state of Tamaulipas and on several highways in the states of Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Le&oacute;n and Sinaloa. Criminals especially target sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks for theft and carjacking along highways.</p><p>In the city of Monterrey, avoid travelling outside the suburb of San Pedro or other well-populated areas after evening rush hour.</p><h3>Western states (see <a title="" href="#risk">Advisory</a>)</h3><p>Criminal activity is high in the states of Colima, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoac&aacute;n and Nayarit. Illegal roadblocks and demonstrations are common. The deterioration of the security situation is particularly noticeable in the rural areas of Guerrero and Michoac&aacute;n. Vigilante militias have fired at vehicles that did not stop at their roadblocks.</p><h3>Crime</h3><p><span>Crime rates in Mexico are high. Arrest and detention rates are low and contribute to higher levels of criminality. The level of crime in resorts and major tourist cities and destinations is relatively low compared to the national average. </span></p><p><span>More than 2.1 million Canadians travel to Mexico each year, the vast majority of them without incident.</span></p><p><span>If you are the victim of a crime, report it immediately to the local branch of the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office (<span>Agencia del Ministerio P&uacute;blico</span>) nearest to the crime scene. No criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint to Mexican authorities. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico. You must present photo identification. It is especially important to report the loss or theft of your identification documents, both to Mexican authorities and to the nearest Canadian consular point of service in Mexico, in order to protect yourself should the documents later be misused.</span></p><h3>Organized crime</h3><p>Although it does not target tourists, violence related to organized crime has been on the rise throughout the country in 2017, including in the states of Quintana Roo and Baja California Sur.</p><p>Criminal groups, including drug cartels, are very active in Mexico. &lrm;Clashes between cartels or gangs over territory, drugs and smuggling routes are common, resulting in a high level of violence. Mexican citizens and government officials are also targets of violent crime, including kidnapping, extortion and homicide.</p><p>Foreigners may be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and could become victims of violent crime. Remain vigilant, stay in tourist areas and follow local media closely. Be very cautious on major highways and in rural areas. Avoid travelling at night.</p><p>In some parts of the country, military, navy and federal police forces have been deployed to combat organized crime and improve security conditions. They maintain a visible presence by patrolling the streets, setting up roadblocks and conducting random vehicle checks. Armed clashes between security forces and criminal groups do occur in certain areas without warning. Bystanders could get caught in the crossfire.</p><h3>Theft</h3><p>Theft&mdash;including armed robbery, purse snatching and pickpocketing&mdash;is common in Mexico. If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist. Tourists have been injured while trying to resist armed robberies. Be aware of your surroundings at all times, even in areas normally considered safe. Take precautions to secure your belongings and minimize your risk of becoming a target for thieves. Always keep your luggage secure. Stay in hotels and resorts with good security. While swimming in resort areas, leave your passport and valuables in the hotel safe, not in your hotel room or on the beach. Dress down and avoid wearing expensive jewelry.</p><p>Foreigners have been targets of robberies that sometimes involve assault. Robbers will follow a victim after they exchange or withdraw money at airports, currency exchange bureaus (casas de cambio) and automated banking machines (ABMs). Avoid withdrawing or exchanging money in public areas of the airport. If you must make a financial transaction at the airport, ensure only small amounts are involved and make the transaction within the customs area.</p><p>Only withdraw or exchange money at ABMs or exchange bureaus during the day or inside reputable financial institutions, hotels and malls; avoid street-side withdrawals and exchanges. This will help you avoid card skimming (i.e. the illegal collection of data from the magnetic strip of a credit or debit card). Always hide the keypad when entering your personal identification number, even if nobody else is around. Keep your credit card in sight when paying for goods and services.</p><p>Canadians have been robbed on buses, usually at night. Keep an eye on your luggage, money and personal documents at all times.</p><h3>Assault</h3><p>Foreigners have been physically and sexually assaulted. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel at popular tourist destinations were involved. Ensure your accommodations have adequate security features (such as cameras and security guards with radios), as not all resorts offer the same level of security.</p><p>Avoid walking after dark, especially alone, and avoid deserted or under-populated areas. Only go to bars and nightclubs in a group and avoid separating from the group. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption, and do not accept invitations or rides from strangers or recent acquaintances, as these can make you a more vulnerable target for criminals. In cases of sexual assault, police authorities will order a medical examination.</p><h3>Women&rsquo;s safety</h3><p>Female travellers should exercise caution when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Consult our publication entitled <a title="" href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/her-own-way">Her Own Way: A Woman&rsquo;s Safe-Travel Guide</a> for travel safety information for Canadian women.</p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances or strangers, including taxi drivers, as the items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Kidnappings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Mexico has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world. Kidnappers target both the wealthy and middle class. Foreigners are not specifically targeted but may be if perceived as being wealthy. Canadian citizens (and contractors working for Canadian businesses) are kidnapped mainly in the areas included in the regional advisory for the northern states, mostly in areas that are not under &nbsp;police and security forces control. If you are kidnapped, comply with the kidnappers&rsquo; requests and do not attempt to resist them.</p><p>Express kidnappings (i.e. attempts to get quick cash in exchange for the release of an individual) occur in large urban areas. Thieves most commonly work in cooperation with, or pose as, taxi drivers. They force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ABMs in exchange for their release. Victims are sometimes held overnight so that a second withdrawal up to the victim&rsquo;s daily bank withdrawal limit can be made the following day. To reduce your risk of becoming a victim, only use the taxi services located at major hotels or call a reputable taxi company, do not show signs of affluence and be aware of your surroundings at all times.</p><p>Gangs and other criminals throughout Mexico also commonly commit virtual kidnapping. This is a form of extortion where a perpetrator identifies a person who is temporarily unreachable by cell phone or email, or steals their cell phone, and then contacts that person&rsquo;s family claiming that their loved one has been kidnapped and demanding an immediate ransom for their release. When the family members cannot reach their loved one in Mexico, they assume that the person has been kidnapped.</p><p>Perpetrators use various means of gathering information about potential victims, including using social media sites or eavesdropping on conversations. Do not discuss travel plans, your room number or any other personal information within earshot of strangers. Do not divulge personal business details to strangers in person or over the phone, especially when using hotel phones. Hotel guests are targeted in a scam where hotel staff are complicit in the virtual kidnapping crime. If you are threatened or harassed on the phone, hang up immediately. Scam artists have also gathered information on luggage tags in hotel lobbies and later convinced guests to give them their contact information in Canada. Afterward, the scammers have called parents of travelling Canadians to report that their child has been detained or hospitalized and have requested that money be wired to Mexico. If this occurs, parents or friends should request the name and note the number of the caller and report the call to local police in Canada.</p><p>Report any kidnapping, physical or virtual, to the local Mexican police and to the Embassy of Canada to Mexico in Mexico City, the nearest Canadian consulate or the Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa (see <a title="" href="#assistance">Assistance</a>).</p><h3>Scams</h3><p>Legitimate police officers have extorted money from tourists or arrested tourists for minor offences or traffic violations. If this occurs, do not hand over your money or your passport. Instead, ask for the officer&rsquo;s name, badge and patrol car number, and a copy of the written fine, which is payable at a later date; also, note the location of the arrest. If you think the fine is not justified, file a complaint at the nearest tourism office or local branch of the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office (Agencia del Ministerio P&uacute;blico).</p><p>Police officers have also targeted rental cars to extort money from passengers.</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country. Protests and roadblocks are common in Mexico City, including to and from the airport, and in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoac&aacute;n and Oaxaca. Such incidents may last a long time, leading to shortages of fresh food, medicine and gasoline, as well as interruption of inter-city bus transportation.</p><p>Avoid large gatherings, which could erupt in violence at any time. Foreigners are forbidden from participating in political demonstrations. Offenders may be detained, deported and denied re-entry into Mexico. Monitor local media reports for up-to-date information and follow the advice of local authorities.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Mexican driving styles and road safety standards are very different from those in Canada. Police do not regularly patrol the highways. Drivers do not observe speed limits, indicate lane changes or stop at red lights. Pedestrians should be extremely cautious at all times. Fatal hit-and-run accidents occur.</p><p>Road conditions vary and can be poor in some areas. Dangerous curves, poorly marked or hidden road signs, construction sites, roaming livestock, slow-moving or abandoned vehicles and other obstacles pose hazards.</p><p>Avoid road travel at night between cities throughout the country. Toll (cuota) highways are typically safer and better maintained than secondary highways. Overnight, ensure that you only stop in major centres, at reputable hotels or at secure campsites. At all times, keep your car doors locked and the windows rolled up, especially at traffic lights, where you can be a target for thieves. Do not leave valuables in the vehicle.</p><p>Rent cars that do not have stickers or other advertisements for the rental company on them so that your vehicle blends in with those of the general population.</p><p>The military searches for drugs and firearms at military checkpoints throughout the country. Remain calm and cooperate.</p><p>In the event of a vehicle breakdown or roadside emergency, the Green Angels (Angeles Verdes), a highway patrol service offered by Mexico&rsquo;s Ministry of Tourism (Secretar&iacute;a de Turismo de M&eacute;xico or SECTUR), provides free assistance on all major toll highways from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. In case of an emergency, dial 078 or 01 800 006 8839 (toll free in Mexico). Ensure that the insurance coverage on your credit card is sufficient. Mexican liability insurance is mandatory.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Taxis</h3><p>Avoid hailing taxis on the street. Use reputable taxis companies, such as online transportation companies, hotel taxis or taxis based at designated stands (sitios). In Mexico City, all government-authorized taxis have licence plates starting with &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;B.&rdquo; Taxis from designated stands have both the logo of their company and the plate number stamped on the side of the car. Always ask the dispatcher for the driver&rsquo;s name and the taxi&rsquo;s licence plate number, model and colour.</p><p>When arriving at Benito Ju&aacute;rez International Airport in Mexico City, pre-pay the taxi fare inside the airport and ask to see the driver&rsquo;s official identification. You can also hire a taxi from a reputable online transportation network company.</p><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Although public transportation is relatively safe, be vigilant in airports, at bus stations and on buses. The Mexico City metro is often very crowded and a popular place for pickpocketing. There are metro cars located at the front of the trains dedicated to women and children during rush hours only. Avoid travelling late at night and during rush hour, if possible, and exercise caution at all times.</p><p>When travelling to other cities, use bus companies that offer first or executive class transportation. These buses only travel on toll roads, which lowers the risks of targeted roadblocks and robberies. For longer distances, fly whenever possible.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p>Learn more <a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">about foreign domestic airlines</a>.</p><h3>Recreational activities and rentals</h3><p>Ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance and that sporting and aquatic equipment is safe and in good condition, especially for scuba diving. Many operators do not conduct regular safety checks.</p><p>Canadians have been involved in accidents where operators of recreational vehicles, such as watercrafts, have demanded compensation exceeding the value of the damage caused to the vehicle or equipment.</p><p>The number of moped and scooter accidents involving tourists is increasing. Avoid renting from operators who do not provide insurance or a helmet.</p><h3>&nbsp;Beaches and water activities</h3><p>Strong currents and undertow are common on many of Mexico's beaches, and drownings of Canadians have occurred. Take posted warnings about swimming conditions seriously and familiarize yourself with the beach flagging system. Many beaches do not offer warnings of dangerous conditions or are not sufficiently supervised by lifeguards. Beach resort lifeguards may not always be prepared for emergencies. When in doubt, consult hotel staff or local authorities</p><p>Storm swells (known locally as mar de fondo) generally occur on the west coast of Mexico between May and November and can result in one- to four-metre high waves. The period of unusually high waves can last for several hours or days. Avoid swimming in the ocean, walking on the beach and practicing any water sports when a mar de fondo alert is issued by local authorities. Follow the instructions of lifeguards and civil protection authorities, and withdraw all small vessels from the sea and safeguard them.</p><h3>General security information</h3><p>Monitor local news sources on a regular basis to learn about events that could affect your personal safety. Leave your itinerary and contact information with friends or family in Canada.</p><p>Hitchhiking is not a common practice in Mexico and is strongly discouraged.</p><p>Exercise caution when standing close to balcony railings, as falls have resulted in deaths and injuries. Height standards for balcony railings in Mexico can be considerably lower than those in Canada.</p>

The police sometimes ask foreign drivers to show identification and proof of their legal status in Mexico. Always carry valid photo identification, your Canadian passport, visa and other pertinent documents. Leave a certified copy of your vehicle registration with relatives or friends in Canada.</p><h4>Renting vehicles</h4><p>If you rent a car, the rental contract must be in your name and include a full description of the vehicle. If driving a company-owned vehicle, you must produce proof of employment with the company and the company&rsquo;s ownership of the vehicle.</p><h4>Auto insurance</h4><p>Canadian automobile insurance is not valid in Mexico. You must obtain additional insurance at the Mexican border. You should obtain full coverage, including coverage for legal assistance. Automobile insurance is much more expensive in Mexico than in Canada. Many local drivers do not have any form of car insurance.</p><h4>Auto accidents and driving infractions</h4><p>In case of an accident or theft of your vehicle, you should immediately obtain a police report from the nearest local branch of the state prosecutor&rsquo;s office (Agencia del Ministerio P&uacute;blico) and present it within five days to the Mexico City customs office (aduanas) to cancel the Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit.</p><p>If you are involved in a traffic accident, you may face serious legal problems, including imprisonment. You could be taken into custody until responsibility for the accident is determined and all penalties are paid. If you do not have Mexican liability insurance, you could be prevented from leaving the country until all parties agree that adequate financial satisfaction has been received. Depending on the extent of injuries or damages, drivers may face criminal charges.</p><p>If a driver is found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of an accident, or if the driver has no valid driver&rsquo;s licence, their insurance is considered invalid.</p><p>If you receive a fine for a driving infraction in certain parts of the country, the issuing police officer will retain your driver&rsquo;s licence or registration until the fine is paid. Expect delays in recovering the document.</p><h4>Driving restrictions</h4><p>In order to reduce air pollution, there are time and day restrictions on driving in Mexico City and other regions of the country. Based on licence plate numbers, there is at least one day each week and two Saturdays per month when driving is forbidden. This applies equally to permanent, temporary and foreign plates. These regulations are strictly enforced. Offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of their vehicle.</p><p>A supplementary driving restriction is in effect in Mexico City. Only vehicles bearing plates from the State of M&eacute;xico (Estado de M&eacute;xico) or the Federal District (Distrito Federal) are allowed to circulate from Monday to Friday from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. and Saturdays from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. For more information, consult the city&rsquo;s environment ministry, <a href="http://www.sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/">Secretar&iacute;a del Medio Ambiente</a> (in Spanish).</p><p>An exemption to this driving restriction may be obtained for cars with foreign plates by requesting a tourist pass (Pase Tur&iacute;stico), which is granted either for two periods of seven days or one period of 14 days within a six-month period. In order to obtain the tourist pass, you must register at <a href="http://www.paseturistico.df.gob.mx/pasetur/">Pase Tur&iacute;stico</a> (in Spanish).</p><!-- END driving --><!-- START importing_vehicles_and_boats --><h3>Importing vehicles and boats</h3><p>Mexico has very strict rules regarding the importation of foreign vehicles and boats. Do not enter Mexico without having obtained the proper import permit and car/boat insurance. Without a permit, you may be fined and have your vehicle seized. Contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://w03.international.gc.ca/Protocol-Protocole/Missions.aspx?lang=eng&_ga=1.110089733.187250597.1429113659">Mexican embassy or a consulate in Canada</a> to verify the latest regulations and requirements regarding vehicle and boat importation, or visit <a href="https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/canada/index.php/en/travelbyland">Travelling to Mexico by land</a>. Consult Mexico&rsquo;s tax department, <a href="http://www.sat.gob.mx/aduanas/vehiculos/importacion_temporal/Paginas/english_version.aspx">Servicio de Administraci&oacute;n Tributaria</a>, for more information.</p><p>If you wish to travel with your car beyond the northern border zone, you must obtain the Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit (Solicitud de importaci&oacute;n temporal de veh&iacute;culos). This permit can only be obtained at the port of entry or online at <a href="https://www.banjercito.com.mx/registroVehiculos/">Banco Nacional del Ej&eacute;rcito, Fuerza A&eacute;rea y Armada</a> before crossing into Mexico.</p><p>You are only allowed to bring one vehicle into the country at a time. You may not tow a vehicle with a recreational vehicle unless it is registered to a different owner who is travelling with you. The second vehicle cannot weigh more than 3.5 tons. It is your responsibility to obtain the permit through the <a href="https://www.banjercito.com.mx/registroVehiculos/">Banco Nacional del Ej&eacute;rcito, Fuerza A&eacute;rea y Armada</a> 10 to 180 days before departure. You may also obtain a permit from a Mexican consulate in the United States (in Albuquerque, Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Sacramento and San Bernardino), a customs office located along the U.S.-Mexico border or, in some cases, within an authorized border zone. Watch for signs indicating customs checkpoints and bank locations (where permits can be issued and cancelled).</p><p>If you stay beyond the date indicated on the Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit, your vehicle may be seized.</p><p>When leaving Mexico, you must return your Temporary Vehicle Importation Permit in person and in the vehicle with which you entered the country, to any customs office at the border so that the permit can be cancelled. Keep a copy of the cancellation documents. Neither the Canadian embassy in Mexico City nor the Embassy of Mexico in Ottawa can return these permits on behalf of Canadian citizens. It is not permissible to mail your permit to the border point. While the permit is in effect, you will be unable to import another vehicle into Mexico. You may be able to cancel the permit on a future visit to Mexico if you enter at the same border point with the same vehicle; however, a fine may be imposed.</p><p>In cases where the permit holder cannot exit the country with the vehicle (for example, in case of death or sickness), the person driving the car out of Mexico must be a foreigner with a valid tourist card and have documentation to prove the relationship with the car owner, such as a marriage or birth certificate.</p><p>It is the owner&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain the import permit for a boat through the Banco Nacional del Ej&eacute;rcito, Fuerza A&eacute;rea y Armada 7 to 60 days before departure. Permits can also be obtained from a Mexican consulate located in Albuquerque, Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Bernardino. Further information and online application forms can be found at <a href="https://www.banjercito.com.mx/registroVehiculos/">Banco Nacional del Ej&eacute;rcito, Fuerza A&eacute;rea y Armada</a>.</p><p>For more information on Mexican driver&rsquo;s permits, vehicle inspection, road tax or mandatory insurance, contact the SECTUR at 1 866 640 0597 (toll free from Canada).</p><!-- END importing_vehicles_and_boats --><!-- START buying/selling_a_vehicle --><h3>Buying/selling a vehicle</h3><p>Foreigners who wish to buy a car in Mexico must be either temporary or permanent residents in Mexico, and must pay vehicle taxes and obtain Mexican licence plates. If you are interested in buying a car, consult local authorities.</p><p>It is illegal to sell your imported vehicle in Mexico. If you do, your vehicle may be seized and you may be subject to a fine and deportation.</p><!-- END buying/selling_a_vehicle --><!-- START real_estate --><h3>Real estate</h3><p>You may acquire real estate in Mexico. However, you should consult a lawyer, as real estate transactions, laws and practices can be complex and differ considerably from those in Canada. Choose your own lawyer or notary and avoid hiring the one recommended by the seller. Mexican real estate agents are not licensed or regulated.</p><p>Research potential property purchases carefully, as irregularities, most frequently title challenges, occur that may result in litigation and possible eviction. Trusts do not guarantee that the purchase is legitimate. Visit the local property registry (Registro de Propiedad) and ask to see the property registry to confirm the name of the last owner and that the property is free of any mortgage.</p><p>Reports of problems with timeshare arrangements (including cancellation of contracts and fraudulent sales) have increased. You may be approached by persistent timeshare representatives on the street, as well as at the airport or on the way to your hotel. Representatives use pressure tactics, such as insisting that promotions are only valid for that day or offering free tours, meals, gifts or alcoholic beverages.</p><p>Before purchasing a timeshare, gather as much information as possible, including researching the properties and getting a legal opinion. If you decide to buy, carefully review the contract. Anything not included in the contract will not be honoured. Only provide your credit card if you are certain you want to make the purchase.</p><p>Timeshare companies have requested that their clients sign a waiver that prevents them from cancelling the contract. This practice is illegal. Consumers are legally entitled to cancel a timeshare contract without penalty within five working days (starting from the day following the original date of purchase). Contracts must be cancelled in writing directly with the timeshare company. Keep copies of all correspondence.</p><p>Fraudulent companies and individuals may approach you claiming to have a buyer for your timeshare and asking you to pay taxes beforehand. After making this payment, Canadians have discovered that their timeshare was never sold.</p><p>Scam artists also often impersonate Mexican government officials. If you experience any difficulty with a timeshare company, or suspect fraud in real estate procedures, contact the Mexican Consumer Protection Agency (Procuradur&iacute;a Federal del Consumidor or <a href="http://www.profeco.gob.mx/Servicios/quejas_denun_ingles.asp">PROFECO</a>) immediately.</p><p>If you are considering purchasing or selling property in Mexico, or suspect you may have fallen victim of a scam, consult a <a href="http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/mexico-mexique/consul/lawyers-avocats.aspx?lang=eng">lawyer</a> in Mexico specializing in real estate.</p><!-- END real_estate --><!-- START rental_accommodations --><h3>Rental accommodations</h3><p>Rental agreements between two individuals in Mexico are considered a private matter and are not regulated by the government. If you encounter difficulties with a rental agreement and wish to take legal action, you must obtain the services of a Mexican lawyer.</p><!-- END rental_accommodations --><!-- START money --><h3>Money</h3><p>The currency is the Mexican peso (MXN/MXV). Automated banking machine services are available throughout the country. Canadian debit and credit cards are widely accepted; however, Canadian currency and traveller&rsquo;s cheques are not. Some Canadians have recently reported that they were unable to withdraw cash from ABMs using Canadian debit cards. Consult with your bank before you travel.</p><p>There is a limit to the amount of U.S. dollars that residents and foreigners can exchange in Mexico, depending on your immigration status in Mexico. Although the <a title="" href="https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/canada/index.php/en/servicesforeigners/7507-exchangedollars-pesos">rule</a> does not apply to Canadian dollars, some financial institutions, hotels and currency exchange bureaus do not make the distinction.</p><!-- END money -->

The earthquake resulted in at least 280 deaths and caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure in Mexico City and in the states of Estado Mexico, Guerrero, Morelos and Puebla. Check with your travel agent or tour operator to confirm hotel conditions before travelling.</p><p>Some volcanoes in Mexico are active. You may obtain updated information on the status of the Colima volcano from the University of Colima&rsquo;s Centre for Studies and Research of Volcanology, <a title="" href="http://portal.ucol.mx/cueiv/Volcan-colima.htm">Centro Universitario de Estudios e Investigaciones de Volcanologia</a> (in Spanish) and of the Popocat&eacute;petl volcano in central Mexico from Mexico&rsquo;s national centre for disaster prevention, Centro Nacional de Prevenci&oacute;n de Desastres or <a title="" href="http://www.gob.mx/cenapred">CENAPRED</a>, (in Spanish).&nbsp;</p>
