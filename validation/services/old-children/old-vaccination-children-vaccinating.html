        <h2 id="s1">Feeling comfortable with vaccinating</h2>


         <p>Getting your child vaccinated (also known as immunization, shots, vaccines, needles) on time is an important job for a parent.&nbsp; When vaccinated, children are protected from <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/index-eng.php" rel="external">serious diseases</a>, usually for the rest of their lives. Sometimes they need another 'booster' vaccination to keep the protection long-lasting.</p>  <p>Parents agree that feeding and sleeping schedules are important to help keep children healthy. The same goes for childhood vaccinations. Vaccinating your children is the best way to keep them safe from many serious and potentially deadly diseases. You can help protect your children by getting them vaccinated on time and keeping their shots up-to-date.</p>  <p>Your child depends on you for this protection.</p>



        <h2 id="s2">Why vaccinate babies?</h2>

         <p>Children are immunized early in life because they are vulnerable to diseases and the consequences can be very serious. Vaccines work best when they are given on time, beginning when your child is very young. The vaccination schedule is designed to protect your child before they are exposed to vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>  <p>Some vaccines are given together to protect against several diseases at once.&nbsp; Your child's immune system is amazing.&nbsp; It can easily handle more than one vaccine at a time safely and effectively.</p>  <p>Your healthcare provider will let you know which vaccines your child needs at each visit.</p>  <p> Vaccination is a lifelong process.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/apps/schedule-calendrier/index-eng.php" class="btn btn-primary active" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-size: 20px !important;">Create your  vaccination schedule</a></p>

  <h2 id="s3">How vaccines work</h2>



         <p>Vaccines are made with a tiny amount of dead or weakened germs. They help the immune system learn how to protect itself against disease. Vaccines are a safe and effective way to keep your child from getting very sick from the real disease.</p>  <p>Most vaccines are given by an injection (a needle) into your child's upper arm or thigh. Some vaccines can be given orally (by mouth) or nasally (sprayed into the nose).</p>  <p>Your child can safely get more than one vaccine at a time. Some vaccines protect against several diseases in a single shot, while others are given separately.</p>



        <h2 id="s4">The immune system</h2>



         <p>The immune system is a special network in the body that protects you from germs, like bacteria and viruses that cause diseases. Through a series of steps called the immune response, the immune system learns how to recognize germs. This is so it can fight them if your child is exposed to them in the future.</p>  <p>Your child is exposed to thousands of germs daily home, at daycare or in the grocery store.&nbsp; Most of these germs are harmless and are easily handled by your child's immune system. But some germs can make your child very sick.</p>  <p>Thanks to vaccination, your child's immune system learns how to recognize harmful germs. Vaccines help your child to develop the necessary defenses to fight disease, and to stay healthy!</p>







        <h2 id="s5">Vaccines work</h2>




         <p>The dead or weakened germs in vaccines help your child's immune system make tools like antibodies and immune memory. Together, these tools will help your child recognize and fight off the germs if exposed to them in the future.</p>  <p>Most children are fully protected after they are vaccinated. This means that they will never get serious <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/index-eng.php" rel="external">vaccine-preventable diseases</a>.</p>  <p>In rare cases, children who are immunized can still get the disease. This is because they only get partial protection from the vaccine.&nbsp; This is more common in children with a health problem that affects their immune system. They may develop mild symptoms if they are exposed to a disease, but will not suffer serious complications.</p>







        <h2 id="s6">Vaccines are safe</h2>





         <p>Vaccines are safe and provide important benefits for your children's health throughout their lives.</p>
	<p>Many parents with young children have not seen serious vaccine-preventable diseases. They may not know how serious the diseases are. As a result, parents may worry more about the side effects of vaccines than the diseases they prevent.</p>  <p>Like all medicines, vaccines need to <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/brgtherap/activit/fs-fi/vaccin-reg-eng.php" rel="external">go through a series of tests</a> before they can be used in Canada. Several systems are in place to monitor the creation, the use and the safety of vaccines. Vaccine reactions are reported by health care providers to local public health authorities. This is to make sure unusual or unexpected reactions can be dealt with quickly.</p>





<h2 id="sick">Can my child get sick from vaccines?</h2>

         <p>No. Vaccines cannot make you sick and you cannot get the disease from the vaccine. Most vaccines do not contain live virus, and those vaccines that do contain live viruses cannot make you sick. Vaccines that have live viruses are severely weakened to the point that is enough to trigger an immune response, but not to cause any illness.</p>

        <h2 id="autism">Do vaccines cause autism?</h2>

         <p>No. Vaccines do not cause autism.</p>

 <p>Medical researchers and scientists around the world have not found a link between vaccines and autism. The study that had initially reported a link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism was retracted in 2011.</p>

 <p>Evidence-based reviews performed by the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) have rejected any causal associations between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders in children. In addition to these reviews, a Danish research team studied children born between 1991 and 1998 (537,303 children) and concluded that there is no difference in the rate of autism between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.</p>

 <p>Some speculation has tried to link thimerosal (a preservative added to multi-dose vaccines to protect vaccines from contamination with germs) in the MMR vaccine to autism, but the MMR vaccine routinely used in Canada has never contained thimerosal. DTaP, polio and Hib vaccines have not contained this preservative since 1997-98.</p>

 <p>Although the reason for the increase in autism is not yet conclusively known, one explanation may be the broader definition and inclusion of many more behaviours and learning disorders within autistic spectrum disorders.</p>


        <h2 id="reactions">Do vaccines cause severe reactions?</h2>
 <p>Just like any medication, vaccines can cause some reactions.</p>

 <p>Some people can experience mild reactions from vaccines, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">pain, redness or swelling at the injection site</li>
<li class="bullet">mild fever after the vaccination</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Depending on the vaccine received, some people may also experience a mild rash, fatigue and aches. All these are common reactions and resolve in a few days.</p>

 <p>Severe reactions, such as an allergic reaction to a vaccine, are rare. If you or your child has had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of a vaccine, talk to your healthcare provider.</p>



	    <h2 id="additives">Additives and preservatives in vaccines</h2>

        <p>Additives and preservatives are added to vaccines to maintain the quality and effectiveness of vaccines. Vaccine residuals are substances that are added as part of the production process to make the vaccine, but are removed from the final product .</p>

	<ul class="list-unstyled">
		<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Gelatin</summary>
 <p>The use of gelatin in vaccines as an additive has been reduced, even though the incidence of allergic reactions is currently very low. Some vaccines contain gelatin to protect them against freeze-drying or heat. Gelatin is also used as a stabilizer in live vaccines. </p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Thimerosal</summary>
 <p>No vaccine in Canada since March 2001 for routine use in children contains thimerosal, with the exception of some influenza vaccines. DTaP, polio and Hib vaccines have not contained this preservative since 1997-98. The MMR vaccine used in Canada has never contained thimerosal.Thimerosal is an ethyl mercury derivative. It is a preservative used only in multi-dose vials of vaccines, and not in single-dose vials or syringes. Low doses of thimerosal have not been shown to produce any negative health effects.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Aluminum salts</summary>
 <p>Aluminum salts (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, or potassium aluminum sulfate) are used as adjuvants, substances added to a vaccine to enhance and strengthen the immune system’s response. Aluminum is naturally present in our environment, including air, food, earth and water, and presents little risk to people. The safety of aluminum salts has been established over the past 70 years, with millions of people being vaccinated with aluminum-containing vaccines.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Squalene</summary>
<p>Squalene is a naturally occurring substance often found in plants, animals and humans, as well as foods and cosmetics. It is a compound produced by the liver and circulates freely throughout the bloodstream. Squalene has been added as an adjuvant to some seasonal influenza vaccines in Canada to increase the immune response and improve their efficacy for certain age groups.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Formaldehyde</summary>
 <p>Formaldehyde is sometimes used in the manufacturing process of vaccines to inactivate viruses and toxins. However, it is mostly removed during the purification process. Formaldehyde occurs naturally in the human body and helps with metabolism. There is approximately ten times the amount of formaldehyde in a baby’s body at any time than there is in a vaccine.</p>
</details>
</li>






        <h2 id="s7">Vaccination versus the actual disease</h2>




         <p>Some people believe that getting the actual disease is safer than the vaccine.&nbsp; Your child's natural immune system has no problem handling the weak or dead germs in a vaccine. Your child may have a mild fever or a sore arm after vaccination. These side effects only last a few days and should not disrupt daily activities.</p>  <p>However, if an unvaccinated child catches the real disease, the result can be serious, or even fatal. This is because active germs multiply quickly, and your child's immune system is not prepared to defend itself.</p>




        <h2 id="s8">Where to get more facts</h2>





         <p>It is important to get the facts about vaccination from reliable sources. Talk to a trusted health care provider about your child's vaccinations. Trusted sources include your:</p>  <ul>
 <li class="bullet">doctor</li>
 <li class="bullet">nurse</li>
 <li class="bullet">pharmacist</li></ul>

 <p></p>


 <p>The internet has a lot of helpful information about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases. However, there is also misinformation on the web. Some of it can be harmful if used to make health decisions. Here are some websites you can trust to find information on vaccination:</p>  <ul>
