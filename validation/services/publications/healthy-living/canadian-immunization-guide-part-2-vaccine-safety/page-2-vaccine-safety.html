         <p>As vaccine preventable infections have decreased, the spotlight of public and media concern has shifted to vaccine safety. Since vaccines are usually given to healthy people, especially children, tolerance for adverse events following immunization is low. Perceived vaccine safety risks receive as much media attention as real safety risks and can be difficult to dispel despite credible scientific evidence. Loss of confidence in the safety of vaccines threatens the continued success of immunization programs.</p>  <p>Vaccine pharmacovigilance has been defined as the science and activities related to the detection, assessment, understanding and communication of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and other vaccine-related or immunization-related issues, and to the prevention of untoward effects of the vaccine or immunization. Health care providers have essential and pivotal roles to play in vaccine pharmacovigilance, including gaining and maintaining public confidence in the safety of vaccines.</p>  <p>Health care providers can develop competency in pharmacovigilance by:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Integrating into their practice knowledge about the main steps in vaccine development and evaluation (Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC], <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/immunization-competencies-health-professionals.html#a3">Immunization Competencies for Health Professionals&nbsp;- Vaccine Development and Evaluation</a>).</li>

 <dt>
  How:
 </dt> 
 <dd> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Health Canada regulators have processes in place to maximize vaccine safety throughout the product life cycle - i.e., pre-marketing and post-marketing.</li> 
   <li class="mrgn-tp-md">It isn't possible to detect all vaccine side effects through pre-marketing studies, especially if the side effects are very rare (less than 1 in 10,000 subjects). Thus, continuous monitoring of the safety of marketed vaccines is essential for detection of and timely response to vaccine safety signals. A vaccine safety signal is any information that arises from one or multiple sources which suggests a new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known adverse reaction (increased severity and/or increased frequency), between immunization and an event or set of related events, that is judged to be of sufficient concern to justify verification and, as appropriate, remedial action.</li> 
   <li class="mrgn-tp-md">The Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS) is a joint effort of provincial/territorial (P/T) and federal public health authorities and their partners.</li> 
   <li class="mrgn-tp-md">Health care providers should report, without delay, all serious or unexpected AEFI to public health according to <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/ci-rp-eng.php">jurisdictional guidelines</a>: 
    <ul> 
     <li class="mrgn-tp-sm"><strong>AEFI:</strong> any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of a vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease.</li> 
     <li class="mrgn-tp-sm"><strong>Serious adverse event (SAE):</strong> one which is life-threatening and/or which results in any one or more of the following: hospitalization, prolongation of an existing hospitalization, permanent disability, congenital abnormality, fatal outcome.</li> 
     <li class="mrgn-tp-sm"><strong>'unexpected' AEFI:</strong> one which is not included in the official product label (as listed in the package leaflet and/or product monograph)</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li class="mrgn-tp-md">While prompt reporting of serious and/or unexpected AEFI is essential to detect emerging signals and monitor vaccine safety, one or even many AEFI reports do not constitute proof that a vaccine causes an AEFI. Causality assessment requires scientific or epidemiologic evidence to answer the question 'Can it?' and then accurate diagnosis and thorough investigation to try to answer the question 'Did it?'</li>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Vaccine safety assessment and monitoring is a continuum that spans all phases of the vaccine product 'life cycle' from discovery through market authorization and beyond. Many stakeholders (Refer to <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#p2c1t1">Table 1</a>) and activities (Refer to <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#p2c1t2">Table 2</a>) are involved. Some stakeholders such as vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities have roles and responsibilities throughout the product life cycle, whereas others such as public health authorities and vaccine providers are involved later in the process, from about the time the product is authorized for marketing in Canada.</p>  <p>A great deal is learned about vaccine safety during the testing period prior to market authorization. Testing proceeds in a step wise fashion from non-human to human studies. Clinical trials in humans start out small but increase in size and progressively assess immunogenicity, appropriate dose and schedule, safety and finally efficacy. Regulatory oversight is in place to ensure that all phases of testing and production are done in accordance with rigorous standards (Good Laboratory Practices, Good Clinical Practices, Good Manufacturing Processes).</p>  <p>With sufficient evidence that the product has a positive benefit to risk profile, regulators will authorize a new vaccine for marketing. About the same time national expert advisory groups such as NACI review the evidence to develop recommendations for use and public health authorities use a standard framework to determine whether or not publicly-funded immunization programs should be instituted.</p>  <p>Despite all the knowledge gained about a product by the time market authorization is given, there is still more to learn about the safety profile in terms of rare side effects or risk for increased frequency of adverse events. Thus ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety is standard throughout the life cycle and it may be necessary to do special studies to learn more about the safety profile or to investigate issues of concern that may emerge in the post-market period.</p>  <p>Regulatory activities also continue in the post-market period to ensure that all new lots of the product match the properties of those on which marketing approval was based and that product production is consistent and of high quality.</p>  <p>More detail on the specific processes and stakeholder activities in Canada that contribute to vaccine safety are provided below.</p>

         <p>Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) has the mandate to take an integrated approach to managing the health-related risks and benefits of health products and food by:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>minimizing health risk factors to Canadians while maximizing the safety provided by the regulatory system for health products and food; and</li> 
 <li>promoting conditions that enable Canadians to make healthy choices and providing information so that they can make informed decisions about their health.</li>

         <p>Health Canada's Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate (BGTD) is the Canadian federal authority that regulates biological drugs, including vaccines. Before manufacturers or sponsors are eligible to market a product in Canada, they must submit a "New Drug Submission". This submission contains extensive information and data about the vaccine's safety, efficacy and quality, including the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, details regarding the production of the vaccine, packaging and labelling details, and information regarding therapeutic claims and side effects. The quality evaluation of the submission includes an onsite evaluation of the production facilities as well as laboratory testing of samples from three to five consecutive lots (or batches of vaccine production) to verify manufacturing consistency.</p>  <p>Upon careful review of the all the evidence, the BGTD determines whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks, and the risks can be mitigated. (i.e. risks decreased and their impact reduced), in accordance with Canada's <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._870/index.html">Food and Drugs Act and Regulations</a>. If the submission meets all requirements, the BGTD will issue a <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/notices-avis/index-eng.php">Notice of Compliance</a> and a <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/activit/fs-fi/dinfs_fd-eng.php">Drug Identification Number (DIN)</a> for market authorization.</p>  <p>Compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is an additional Health Canada requirement for selling vaccines in Canada. The Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate (HPFBI) ensures this compliance through issuance of Establishment Licenses via its own GMP inspections or through Mutual Recognition Agreements with international regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>The purpose of the lot release program is to ensure to the extent possible that each newly manufactured batch of vaccine matches the lots used to generate the safety and efficacy data for market authorization. Each vaccine lot is subject to the lot release program before sale in Canada. Specifically, an official document containing results of key quality control tests performed throughout the manufacturing process of each individual lot must be submitted to and is reviewed by Health Canada before a release letter is issued to allow the sale of the lot on the Canadian market. Moreover, as part of its lot release program, Health Canada performs testing of most vaccine lots as per its <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/brgtherap/applic-demande/guides/lot/index-eng.php">Lot Release Guidelines</a>. In addition, vaccine manufacturers must submit a Yearly Biological Product Report, which summarizes the quality information for all the lots manufactured in their facility for each product. These strategies allow Health Canada to assess how well the manufacturing process is controlled and that the quality control tests remain suitable.</p>  <p>In addition, regular GMP inspections are conducted to ensure continued compliance to Good Manufacturing Practice and renewal of establishment licenses for vaccine manufacturing facilities.</p>

        <h5>Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS)</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>CAEFISS is a collaborative post-marketing federal/provincial/territorial (F/P/T) surveillance system with the following objectives:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>to continuously monitor the safety of marketed vaccines in Canada;</li> 
 <li>to identify increases in the frequency or severity of previously identified vaccine-related reactions;</li> 
 <li>to identify previously unknown AEFI that could possibly be related to a vaccine (unexpected AEFI);</li> 
 <li>to identify areas that require further investigation and/or research; and</li> 
 <li>to provide timely information on AEFI reporting profiles for vaccines marketed in Canada that can help inform immunization-related decisions.</li> 
</ul>  <p>CAEFISS includes spontaneous, enhanced and active AEFI reporting processes. Each province and territory has their own reporting system that includes activities at the local/regional as well as the provincial/territorial level. (Refer to the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/ci-rp-eng.php">FPT contact information for AEFI-related questions</a>) All provincial and territorial systems are part of CAEFISS. Spontaneous AEFI reports may come from health care professionals, market authorization holders and the public. F/P/T immunization program authorities encourage vaccine providers and others to report AEFI of particular public health importance and sometimes conduct enhanced AEFI surveillance as part of new publicly-funded immunization programs or as a response to possible emerging vaccine safety signals. In some jurisdictions (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Northwest Territories) AEFI reporting is a legislated requirement.</p>  <p>There is also an active syndromic surveillance component to CAEFFIS. This is provided by the Immunization Monitoring Program - ACT-ive (IMPACT) which is described below.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p><a href="http://www.cps.ca/en/impact" rel="external">IMPACT</a> is a pediatric, hospital-based network funded by PHAC and administered by the Canadian Paediatric Society. IMPACT conducts a national surveillance network for adverse events following immunization, vaccine failures and selected vaccine preventable diseases in children. The 12 IMPACT hospitals encompass approximately 90% of tertiary care pediatric beds in Canada. Nurse monitors actively search for children admitted to IMPACT hospitals with neurologic and other high priority adverse events. The nurse monitors determine whether these events have followed immunization within a timeframe that could implicate vaccine as a possible cause. All such AEFI are reported to PHAC as well as to local public health officials.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h5>How and when to report an AEFI</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Vaccinees and/or their parents/caregivers should be advised to notify their vaccine provider or other healthcare provider about any concerns that arise following immunization. The provider can then assess these concerns and, if appropriate, complete an adverse event report. Providers submit reports to the appropriate jurisdictional authority (e.g. to local or provincial public health). In all cases, these are then reported to the federal authorities so each AEFI can be added into the national CAEFISS database. Refer to the <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/ci-rp-eng.php">FPT contact information for AEFI-related questions</a> which also contains the AEFI Reporting Form and a user guide.</p>  <p>The main purpose of post-marketing AEFI surveillance is to detect vaccine safety signals. The key criteria for reporting an AEFI are temporal association and a suspicion that the vaccine or immunization may have caused the event. One need not be sure that the AEFI was caused by either vaccine or immunization nor does an AEFI report prove causation. Unexpected events that are not listed in the product monograph should be reported. Expected common events such as vaccination site reactions or fever need not be reported unless they are more severe or frequent than usual. <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines.html">Part 4</a> of this Guide provides information on expected common adverse events for vaccines marketed in Canada.</p>  <p>Of greatest priority for timely reporting are serious AEFI (life-threatening and/or which result in any one or more of the following: hospitalization, prolongation of an existing hospitalization, permanent disability, congenital abnormality, fatal outcome). Serious events should be investigated for other causes as appropriate, but reporting should be done without delay. Follow-ups can be sent using the same AEFI report form (specifying that it is a follow-up), and submitted by the same route, once the investigation is complete.</p>  <p>The national <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/aefi-essi-form-eng.php">Adverse Events Following Immunization Report Form</a> and <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/aefi-essi_guide/index-eng.php">User Guide to the Completion and Submission of the AEFI Reports</a> provide detailed guidance for reporting an AEFI.</p>

        <h5>AEFI report flow and associated activities</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p><strong>Local public health officials</strong> are usually the first to receive an AEFI report. Key activities include review by a public health professional for individual public health action related to the advisability of additional doses of implicated vaccine(s). Efforts may also be made to gather additional information, validate a report diagnosis, and follow up investigation results and/or final outcome of the AEFI. In some settings, the reports are entered into an electronic database. Vaccine safety issues such as unexpected events or increases in severity or frequency of expected AEFI, especially vaccination site reactions or allergic events, may first be recognized at the local level. Such concerns are communicated to appropriate regional and/or provincial/territorial personnel for further assessment and investigation if needed.</p>  <p><strong>Provincial/territorial immunization programs</strong> receive and review all AEFI reports to carry out jurisdictional level analysis including estimation of rates of occurrence of specific AEFI and, in some cases, preparation of periodic jurisdictional summaries. With a larger volume of reports than is seen at local levels, this is another opportunity to identify possible safety signals and take action as appropriate. Actions may include: undertaking additional epidemiological investigation; consulting with experts, advising federal public health or regulatory authorities; or creating an AEFI alert to notify and seek input from all F/P/T vaccine safety leads (refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#vvwg">Vaccine Vigilance Working Group</a>). In addition to being the lead on jurisdictional pharmacovigilance activities, P/T vaccine safety coordinators remove personal identifiers in AEFI reports and send the reports to PHAC. Serious AEFI reports are forwarded to PHAC within 15 days or less.</p>  <p><strong>The Vaccine Safety Section at PHAC</strong> receives AEFI reports from multiple sources (from provinces, federal jurisdictions, IMPACT, and manufacturers), identifies duplications and collates them into a national database. Serious events are given priority and are processed within 2 business days. The key activities at the national level include coding of AEFI using the international Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and medical case review to detect vaccine safety signals including any unexpected or unusual AEFI. Analyses are done regularly to search for vaccine safety signals and information is shared with Health Canada. Reports are produced for F/P/T and NACI review.</p>

It is important to note that to be effective there needs to be good communication among the key stakeholders. For example, scientists and regulators need to give information to health care providers, and health care providers need to give information to public health authorities who in turn collate and analyse information for regulators, healthcare providers, scientists and consumers.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Prior to the 1960s, it was erroneously thought that everything that could be known about a product could be learned prior to product authorization. It is now known that while sufficient evidence of safety, efficacy and quality is an absolute requirement for regulators to grant authorization for marketing a product, sufficient evidence does not mean knowing everything that can be known about a product. It is impossible to learn everything about a product prior to authorization and efforts to do so delay proven product benefit from being realized in the population.</p>  <p>Pre-marketing studies are rigorously controlled to ensure that results are valid and reproducible. As a result, subjects in these studies are usually healthy with no underlying conditions. Post-marketing surveillance studies may be needed to determine whether the safety profile is the same in other target populations, such as the immunocompromised or those born prematurely or those with asthma, diabetes or other chronic diseases. In order to detect very rare adverse events (frequency of less than 1 in 10,000 subjects) it is necessary to have 30,000 to over 100,000 subjects in a controlled study. This is rarely practical or possible and would delay the introduction of a proven effective vaccine into the population. The concept of a life cycle for vaccines and other marketed products underscores the fact that knowledge regarding product safety and efficacy must be sought after, as well as before, marketing authorization.</p>  <p><a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#p2c1t2">Table 2</a> describes what is learned about vaccine safety throughout the vaccine life cycle and the accompanying regulatory requirements to ensure data and product quality.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>"Can it?" uses scientific and epidemiologic methods, usually in large populations, to prove that there is a causal association between a vaccine and an adverse event. When the answer to "can it?" is yes, investigators also hope to identify the attributable risk related to the vaccine.</p>  <p>Ideally, the goal of safety studies is to determine vaccine attributable risk, defined as the difference between the frequency of an event in the vaccinated compared to unvaccinated population. Special study designs are needed to determine attributable risk such as those described below. While the first two studies were completed several years ago they remain relevant and are excellent examples of study designs that can inform vaccine safety.</p>  <p>The most rigorous study design is a placebo-controlled randomized control trial, especially those using a cross-over design. An elegant example of such a design is a Finnish study involving 581 twin pairs where one twin of each pair was first given measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and 3 weeks later given a placebo whereas the other twin in the pair first received placebo and 3 weeks later the MMR vaccine. This was done in a double-blinded fashion (i.e., neither the researchers nor the subject caretakers knew whether a given injection was MMR vaccine or placebo). Adverse events were monitored for 21 days after immunization. The results of this classic study are shown in <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#p2c1t3">Table 3</a> and demonstrate two key points. First, fever is a common childhood event affecting 16% to 18% of the placebo group - i.e., a temporally associated coincidental event, related neither to vaccine nor to immunization. Secondly, the risk of fever attributable to MMR vaccine is 2% to 6% and occurs in the interval from 7 to 12 days after immunization.</p>

         <p>An epidemiologic cohort design is another way to measure vaccine attributable risk. A Canadian example is shown in <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#p2c1f1">Figure 1</a>. In this case, the study cohort was children immunized with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine and the measured outcomes were the number of illnesses or clinical symptoms compatible with any adverse event recorded during one week intervals from 4 weeks before to 3 weeks after each vaccine dose. Recorded adverse events increased in the week after hepatitis B immunization but returned to pre-vaccination levels thereafter. The attributable increase in adverse events due to hepatitis B vaccine was limited to the first week after immunization and was 44%, 26% and 38% after doses 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Therefore this means that there is a 44% increase risk of adverse events in the first week after the first dose of vaccine which is determined to be due to vaccine.</p>

         <p>Determining vaccine attributable risk for very rare adverse events (less than 1 in 10,000 subjects) is difficult. In controlled trials, study populations of 30,000 or more are needed. Once a vaccine with proven efficacy has been authorized and marketed in Canada, it is unethical to include placebo groups in studies among people for whom the vaccine is recommended. Thus, special epidemiologic methods are needed to try to control bias, especially related to non-random distribution of immunization in the population.</p>  <p>One powerful method for determining vaccine attributable risk for very rare adverse events is the self-controlled case series design which compares the risk of an event occurring during a defined risk period following vaccine exposure to other time intervals in the same individual's life where no vaccine exposure occurred. This technique has been successfully applied to address vaccine safety controversies (e.g., lack of causal link between MMR or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism) as well as to quantify the attributable risk for some rare events that have been causally linked to vaccine (refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-2-vaccine-safety.html#iom">Institute of Medicine</a>).</p>

         <p>In investigating AEFI clusters and individual cases, reviewers are trying to answer the question "Did it?" (i.e., did one or more administered vaccines cause the observed adverse event or would the event have happened anyway even if the vaccine hadn't been given).</p>  <p>An AEFI is reported based on a suspicion as opposed to a certainty that a given vaccine caused a given adverse event. The actual cause of the AEFI could be one or more of the following based on terms that have been defined by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) - World Health Organization (WHO) Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance:</p>  <ul> 
 <li><strong>Vaccine product-related reaction:</strong> an AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine due to one or more of the inherent properties of the vaccine product. For example: 
  <ul> 
   <li>common to very common AEFI: vaccination site pain and swelling, fever</li> 
   <li>uncommon AEFI: hypotonic-hyporesponsive events (HHE) after infant vaccines;</li> 
   <li>rare AEFI: febrile seizure after MMR vaccine</li> 
   <li>very rare AEFI: anaphylaxis after any vaccine</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Vaccine quality defect-related reaction:</strong> an AEFI that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine that is due to one or more quality defects of the vaccine product including its administration device as provided by the manufacturer. Quality defect is defined as any deviation of the vaccine product as manufactured from its set quality specifications. An example of this occurred in 1955 when Cutter laboratories failed to completely inactivate polio virus in Salk vaccine lots leading to cases of polio infection. This event led to much stronger regulatory oversight of vaccine production and the implementation of Good Manufacturing Practices. With the current level of regulatory oversight to assess vaccine quality, a vaccine quality defect-related reaction is now rare. Nonetheless, the possibility must be considered and a high level of a vigilance maintained when new signals emerge.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Immunization error-related reaction:</strong> an AEFI that is caused by inappropriate usage and, therefore, by its nature is preventable. Inappropriate usage is defined as vaccine handling, prescribing and/or administration other than what is authorized and recommended in a given jurisdiction based on scientific evidence or expert recommendation. An example of this is the development of a sterile nodule at the vaccination site because of using needles that are too short. When needles are too short, it results in subcutaneous deposition of alum-containing vaccine meant to be injected intramuscularly which can result in a sterile nodule.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Immunization anxiety-related reaction:</strong> an AEFI arising from anxiety about the immunization (e.g., syncope or hyperventilation).</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Coincidental event:</strong> an AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine product, immunization error, or immunization anxiety (e.g., acute infection that may have been incubating but not clinically apparent at the time of immunization; emergence of a genetic disorder not yet diagnosed at the time of immunization.)</li> 
</ul>  <p>Each of the above types of adverse events must be considered as a possible 'root cause' whenever a vaccine safety signal is detected and verified. Sometimes it cannot be exactly determined what the root cause was. Depending on the seriousness of the signal it may be necessary to take immediate regulatory action (e.g., lot quarantine or recall) and/or public health action (e.g., suspend or modify immunization program) pending results of the investigation. A signal investigation requires a cooperative effort from multiple stakeholders including F/P/T public health officials, Health Canada regulators, vaccine market authorization holders and, often, vaccine researchers.</p>

        <h4>Will it? - applying vaccine safety evidence to risk communication</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Evidence regarding vaccine safety, as generated throughout the vaccine life cycle helps to inform the risk-benefit discussion between health care providers and potential vaccine recipients or their caregivers. Of greatest use is the determination of vaccine attributable risk. For example, to the question: Will MMR vaccine cause thrombocytopenia? Based on large epidemiologic studies, one can say that MMR vaccine will cause thrombocytopenia once for every 30,000 to 40,000 doses given. Evidence addressing other adverse events can be found in <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines.html">vaccine-specific chapters</a> in Part 4 of this Guide.</p>

         <p>The WHO has a mandate from member states to develop, establish and promote international standards with respect to a wide variety of products including biologics such as vaccines. Since 1965, the WHO has had a global program for International Drug Monitoring which is run out of the <a href="http://www.who-umc.org/" rel="external">Uppsala Monitoring Centre</a> in Sweden. The main objective of the program is safety signal detection at a global level.</p>  <p>In 1999 the WHO established the <a href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/en/index.html" rel="external">Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety</a> (GACVS) to provide independent evidence-based responses to safety issues of global concern. The expert committee meets twice yearly (usually June and December) and publishes their conclusions and recommendations shortly thereafter in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record. The GACVS also maintains a subject-specific topic index at their website. As part of their work, GACVS established the <a href="http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/communication/network/vaccine_safety_websites/en/" rel="external">Vaccine Safety Net</a> which identifies and promotes websites on vaccine safety that adhere to good information practices.</p>

         <p>The <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/" rel="external">IOM</a> was formed in 1970 by the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and functions as an independent, expert professional body that examines issues of relevance to the health of the public. Since 2001, an absolute criterion for membership on IOM Immunization Safety Review Committees has been lack of any association with vaccine manufacturers or their parent organizations and no prior function as a legal expert witness.</p>  <p>For each issue studied, the IOM Immunization Safety Committee reviews all pertinent theoretical, experimental, clinical and epidemiologic evidence and hears presentations from the public and health professionals. The Committee starts from a neutral position, with no prior assumption regarding a positive or negative connection between the vaccine and the issue at hand. The scientific evidence is then reviewed, and biologic mechanisms for a possible causal association carefully considered. Prior to publication, each report is reviewed by an independent expert panel, chosen by the NAS and the IOM but anonymous to the Committee. Reviewer's comments are given due consideration, but ultimately the final published report represents the consensus of the IOM safety panel alone. The IOM website provides access to all committee reports, including the most recent reports published in 2011 The <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2011/Adverse-Effects-of-Vaccines-Evidence-and-Causality.aspx" rel="external">2011 Committee report</a> considered the scientific evidence related to the safety of eight vaccines (MMR, varicella, influenza, human papillomavirus [HPV], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningococcal polysaccharide, meningococcal conjugate, and diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis [DTaP]-containing vaccines). The <a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2013/The-Childhood-Immunization-Schedule-and-Safety.aspx" rel="external">2013 Committee report</a> focused on the safety of the United States immunization schedule for infants and children.</p>
