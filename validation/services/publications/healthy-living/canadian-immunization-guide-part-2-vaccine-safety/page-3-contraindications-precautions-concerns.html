         <p>There are a number of reasons for not giving vaccines. Sometimes vaccines cannot be given or need to be delayed due to contraindications or precautions. Other times people have unfounded concerns that lead to hesitation to get vaccination when there is no increased risk for vaccination. It is critical for vaccine providers to distinguish among these different reasons.</p>  <p>This chapter defines contraindications and precautions and highlights contraindications and precautions contained in other chapters in the Canadian Immunization Guide. It also identifies common concerns and provides information to assist vaccine providers in responding to those concerns. In most cases, these concerns can be addressed with information and reassurance. This chapter is meant to be a user friendly guide to aid in determining whether a particular condition is a contraindication to vaccination, a precaution or a common concern that need not postpone or prevent vaccination.</p>  <p>A <strong>contraindication</strong> is a situation in which a drug, such as a vaccine, should <strong>not</strong> be used because the risk outweighs any potential therapeutic benefit.</p>  <p>A <strong>precaution</strong> is a condition that may increase the risk of an adverse reaction following immunization or that may compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity. In general, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, there may be circumstances when the benefits of giving the vaccine outweigh the potential harm, or when reduced vaccine immunogenicity may still result in significant benefit to a susceptible, immunocompromised host.</p>  <p>Some precautions and contraindications depend on whether a vaccine is an attenuated live product or an inactivated product. Refer to the <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-3-contraindications-precautions-concerns.html#p2c2a1a">list of inactivated vaccines and live, attenuated vaccines</a> authorized and available for use in Canada. For complete vaccine-specific contraindications and precautions, consult the relevant chapter in the Canadian Immunization Guide, the product leaflet, or information contained within the vaccine's product monograph available through Health Canada's <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/databasdon/index-eng.php">Drug Product Database</a>.</p>

         <p>Vaccine providers should question all clients about their current health and any chronic conditions to identify contraindications and precautions to the vaccine before each dose of vaccine is given. Checklists and routine screening questions are useful. Refer to <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-8-vaccine-administration-practices.html">Vaccine Administration Practices</a> in Part 1 for additional information.</p>  <p>The following is a summary of some of the common contraindications and precautions.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine or a component of a vaccine</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>A vaccine is contraindicated in a person with a history of anaphylaxis after previous administration of the same vaccine and in a person with proven immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine (with the exception of egg allergy) or its container. In situations of suspected hypersensitivity or non-anaphylactic allergy to a vaccine or its components, investigation is indicated which may involve immunization in a controlled setting. Consultation with an allergist is advised.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Asthma, severe</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Asthma should be optimized before giving any vaccine. LAIV should not be administered to individuals with severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high dose inhaled glucocorticosteriods or active wheezing) or those with medically attended wheezing in the seven days prior to vaccination. LAIV can be used in stable, non-severe asthmatics.</p>

        <h4>Congenital malformation of gastrointestinal tract or history of intussusception</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Rotavirus vaccine is contraindicated in infants with a history of intussusception or uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusception.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with onset within 6 weeks of immunization</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Cases of GBS or polyneuritis have been reported following administration of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine and there has been one case report of relapsing GBS following each of three doses of vaccine. However, population studies have not supported a causal association. Cases of GBS or polyneuritis have also been reported following receipt of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. While some evidence favours a causal relationship between tetanus toxoid and GBS, there is little evidence to support an independent association between receipt of diphtheria toxoid and GBS. Persons who develop GBS within 6 weeks of receipt of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not receive a further dose. Those who develop GBS outside the 6-week interval may receive subsequent doses of the vaccine. If there is a history of both <em>Campylobacter</em> infection (which has been associated with GBS) and receipt of a tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine within the 6 weeks before the onset of GBS, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is advised.</p>  <p>In a review of studies between 1976 and 2005, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that the 1976 swine flu vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). However, evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between GBS in adults and seasonal influenza vaccination. More recent studies suggest that the absolute risk of GBS in the period following seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination is about one excess case per 1 million vaccines. The risk of GBS associated with influenza vaccination must be balanced against the risk of GBS associated with influenza infection itself. In general, it is recommended to avoid subsequent influenza vaccination of persons known to have had GBS within six weeks of a previous influenza vaccination.</p>

        <h4>Immunocompromised persons</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>In general, <strong>immunocompromised people should not receive live vaccines because of the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strains.</strong> People who are severely immunocompromised or in whom immune status is uncertain should not be given live vaccines. In less severely immunocompromised people, the benefits of vaccination with routinely recommended live vaccines may outweigh risks. When considering immunization of an immunocompromised person with a live vaccine, <strong>approval from the individual's attending physician should be obtained before vaccination.</strong> In complex cases, referral to a physician with expertise in immunization and/or immunodeficiency is advised.</p>

        <h5>Suspicious family or medical history for immunodeficiency disorders</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>People who have a suspicious history for immunodeficiency disorders (e.g., known or suspected family history of congenital immunodeficiency disorder or HIV infection, or history of failure to thrive and recurrent infection), should not be immunized with a live vaccine until they have been fully investigated and T cell dysfunction ruled out. Immunodeficiency states may be undiagnosed in young children presenting for routine immunizations, which include live vaccines. This is particularly important to consider in infants receiving live vaccines (e.g. BCG or travel vaccines) before 12 months of age since underlying conditions are less likely to be diagnosed in younger children. Refer to <a href="../../../../services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-8-immunization-immunocompromised-persons.html">Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons</a> in Part 3 for further information.</p>

        <h5>Immunosuppressive therapy</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Vaccination status should be reviewed for prior to commencing immunosuppressive therapy. If vaccines cannot be given prior to initiation of therapy, it is advisable to delay vaccines until after immunosuppressive therapy has stopped. Inactivated vaccines should be delayed 3 months (to ensure immunogenicity) and live vaccines should be delayed 1-3 months (to reduce the risk of disease caused by the vaccine strain) The interval between discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs and vaccine administration may vary with the intensity of the immunosuppressive therapy, underlying disease and other factors (e.g., inactivated vaccines can be administered if required for post-exposure or outbreak management).</p>  <p>If immunosuppressive therapy cannot be stopped, live vaccines are generally contraindicated, although the risk to benefit ratio may favour immunization if only low doses of immunosuppressive drugs are required and there is significant risk of development of disease. The use of live vaccines in persons on low dose immunosuppression is under review by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI).</p>  <p>In general, the above advice is the same for people taking immunusuppressive monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab or TNF-inhibitors (such as infliximab and adalimumab).&nbsp;An additional consideration is that monoclonal antibodies taken during pregnancy can be transferred to the fetus and their effects may persist after birth. Consultation with an immunologist is strongly advised prior to giving live vaccines to an infant who may have been exposed to monoclonal antibodies during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

        <h3 id="p2c2a3">Common conditions and concerns</h3>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>There are a number of conditions that may be raised as a concern about receiving a vaccine, that in fact should not delay or preclude immunization. For example, routine administration of vaccines should not be postponed in persons with minor illnesses, such as an upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, mild gastrointestinal illness, or concurrent antibiotic therapy. Repeated infectious illnesses are common in early childhood and will not interfere with the efficacy of vaccines. Generally, if a person is well enough to present for immunization in the outpatient setting, he/she is well enough to be immunized.</p>  <p><strong>Opportunities for immunization should not be lost because of unfounded concerns.</strong> Information and reassurance can generally allay reservations about receiving vaccines in these circumstances. The following identifies some of the common concerns and implications for immunization.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="p2c2a3a">Acute illness (with or without fever)</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>In general, people with minor or moderate acute illness may receive vaccines. There is no increase in risk of adverse events following immunization and no interference with response to vaccine. There are three exceptions -</p>  <ul> 
 <li>If significant nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of LAIV to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, TIV can be administered or LAIV could be deferred until resolution of the illness.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">In infants with moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis, rotavirus vaccine should be deferred until the condition improves unless deferral will result in scheduling of the first dose beyond the recommended age limit.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">Administration of oral cholera and travellers' diarrhea vaccine should be postponed in persons with acute gastrointestinal illness.</li> 
</ul>  <p>The risks and benefits of vaccinating a severely ill person need to be carefully assessed. The benefits of protection in a high risk exposure situation or when the window of opportunity is short (i.e., when travel or immunocompromise are imminent) need to be assessed against the risks that a vaccine-related adverse event (particularly fever) could complicate the management of the person. It is possible that systemic adverse events may complicate the medical management of an acute illness or that events associated with the acute illness may be misperceived as vaccine-related adverse events. Expert opinion is strongly recommended in this situation.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4>Adverse event following previous immunization</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>There are numerous adverse events following a previous immunization that may lead to concern regarding another immunization.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h5>Extensive limb swelling following immunization</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>A severe injection site reaction to one vaccine is not associated with an increased risk of injection site reactions to other vaccines. Repeating a dose of a vaccine that was previously associated with a large injection site reaction may result in a similar reaction; however, there is no increased risk of systemic adverse events. A large injection site reaction may occur in a child after the fourth or fifth dose of a diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis-containing vaccine. The presence of a large injection site reaction to a previous dose is not a contraindication to continuing the recommended schedule.<br /> Severe injection site reactions occasionally occur in adults following receipt of diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (Td). Further routine doses of Td vaccine should not be given for at least 10 years.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h5>Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) following immunization</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>HHE may occur following immunization with pertussis-containing vaccine but occurs less frequently following receipt of current acellular pertussis-containing vaccines. There is evidence that there are no adverse consequences to these events.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h5>Febrile seizure or syncope following immunization</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Parents may hesitate to have their child have a vaccine if he/she had a history of a post-immunization febrile seizure. Likewise, people may hesitate to have a vaccine if they had an episode of syncope following a previous vaccine (such as may occur with HPV vaccine in a young girl).</p>  <p>Vaccines are safe to given when there is a history of a febrile seizure. For MMR vaccine for example, the risk of febrile seizures within 2 weeks following MMR vaccination was 1.56 per 1000 children overall, 3.97 per 1000 for siblings of children with a history of febrile seizures, and 19.47 per 1000 for children with a personal history of febrile seizures. This means when a child has a history of a febrile seizure 98% will not have a febrile seizure following an MMR vaccine. Children with a history of febrile seizures have no increased risk of developing a seizure disorder, such as epilepsy. Oral analgesics/antipyretics (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) can be used for treatment of minor adverse reactions such as fever or injection site discomfort that might occur following vaccination. There is no evidence that antipyretics prevent febrile seizures.</p>  <p>Vaccines are safe to give when there is a history of fainting after a vaccine. The likelihood of fainting can be reduced by measures that lower stress in those awaiting immunization, such as short waiting times, comfortable room temperature, preparation of vaccines out of view of recipients, and privacy during the procedure. People should be immunized while seated.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Persistent or inconsolable crying and an unusual, high-pitched cry (most typically after pertussis vaccination) are not associated with any sequelae and are likely to be pain responses at the site of injection in young infants. Refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-1-key-immunization-information/page-8-vaccine-administration-practices.html">Vaccine Administration Practices</a> in Part 1 for comfort measures that can be taken.</p>

        <h5>Ocular-respiratory syndrome (ORS)</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Oculo-respiratory syndrome is a usually transient condition characterized by bilateral conjunctivitis, facial edema, and upper respiratory symptoms that has been known to occur primarily after receiving influenza immunization. Symptoms typically appear 2 to 24 hours after vaccination and resolve within 48 hours of onset. If ORS occurred with lower respiratory symptoms, subsequent influenza vaccine is contraindicated.

        <h4>Allergies</h4>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>A history of allergies is one of the most common concerns that people have about vaccines. There are many types of allergic reactions and it is important to differentiate among them when considering implications for immunization.</p>  <p>Allergic reactions can be either immediate or delayed. An immediate hypersensitivity reaction usually occurs within moments or up to one hour after vaccine. It is IgE mediated (Type 3) and can be either mild (e.g. hives) or severe, such as anaphylaxis. Refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-2-vaccine-safety/page-4-early-vaccine-reactions-including-anaphylaxis.html">Early Vaccine Reactions Including Anaphylaxis</a> in Part 2 for additional information.</p>  <p>Delayed hypersensitivity reactions may appear several hours to days after immunization. These reactions include an Arthus or Type 3 reaction (a local vasculitis due to deposition of IgG-based immune complexes in dermal blood vessels) or more typically, a cell-mediated, delayed hypersensitivity or Type 4 reaction (typically a contact dermatitis). These are typically local reactions to a component of the vaccine.</p>  <p>Severe arthus-type injection site reactions are occasionally reported following receipt of diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines. There may be extensive painful swelling around the injection site, often involving the arm from shoulder to elbow and generally beginning 2 to 8 hours after injection. Persons experiencing severe injection site reactions should not receive further routine doses of Td vaccine for at least 10 years.</p>  <p>On close questioning, it may become evident that people think they have an allergy to a vaccine or vaccine component but it is not an allergy. Most adverse skin events associated with vaccines, for example, are simply a normal inflammatory response to a foreign substance. As these inflammatory reactions are not related to allergy, patients can receive subsequent vaccinations safely. People can be reassured if they have a mild hypersensitivity reaction, such as a contact dermatitis from either the vaccine or one of its components. People with a suspected moderate to severe hypersensitivity reaction, should be referred to an allergist for further testing. Suspected hypersensitivity should not be an ongoing reason to not administer vaccine. It should be investigated by an allergist to clarify whether the person may proceed with vaccination or not.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Anaphylactic egg allergy is rare. People with egg allergy may be immunized with influenza, MMR or MMRV vaccines in the routine manner. The amount of egg protein in these vaccines have been found to be insufficient to cause an allergic reaction in egg-allergic individuals; individuals may be vaccinated without skin testing and with the full dose, irrespective of a past severe reaction to egg. Referral to a specialist with expertise in allergies may be necessary in occasional circumstances where there is strong concern about proceeding with the recommendation above.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>People may report an allergy to a number of vaccine components, such as gelatin, latex, neomycin or thimerosol. Anaphylactic reactions to these components are extremely rare. When mild hypersensitivity reactions occur, vaccines that are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly are generally safe. A thimerosol allergy is extremely rare. If there is a documented history of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to thimerosal (such as a large local reaction or an eczematous rash), immunization with thimerosal-containing vaccines can proceed. In the rare instance of individuals with proven delayed hypersensitivity to thimerosol, they should be advised that long-lasting local or systemic cutaneous reactions can occur. They should report any reaction of concern following immunization so that it can be managed appropriately.

         <p>People with bleeding disorders should receive all recommended immunizations according to routine schedules when appropriate safety measures have been taken. Control of bleeding disorders should be optimized prior to immunization. Vaccine providers should ensure that there are no symptoms or signs compatible with an undiagnosed bleeding disorder (e.g. unexplained bruising). If such indicators are present before immunization, a diagnosis should be established before commencing immunization. When administering a parenteral vaccine, consider use of a small gauge needle and apply pressure for 5-10 minutes after the immunization. Refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-7-immunization-persons-with-chronic-diseases.html">Immunization of Persons with Chronic Diseases</a> in Part 3.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Following routine immunization of either a mother or her infant during breastfeeding there is no reduction in maternal or infant response to vaccines and no increase in the risk of adverse events for either mother or infant. There is some evidence that breastfeeding may have a beneficial effect in infants after vaccination and is associated with less fever and pain. BCG, smallpox and yellow fever vaccines are generally contraindicated in breastfeeding women but may be considered in high-risk situations.</p>

        <h5>Concern about exposure to too many antigens</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Parents often have a concern about exposing their young child to too many antigens when multiple vaccines are recommended at one time. It is useful to identify that the human immune system has an enormous capacity to respond to antigens; infants can respond to about 10,000 different antigens at any one time - and may do so when crawling on the floor. Immunization does not significantly add to the vaccinee's daily exposure to antigens. The vaccines given to young infants in Canada engage less than 0.01% of an infant's immune response capacity. Generally, vaccinees have similar immune responses whether vaccines are given at the same time or at different visits. Concomitant administration of most routine vaccines at the same visit does not result in increased rates of adverse reaction.</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h5>Concern about multiple injections</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Routine administration of all age-appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously is recommended for children without contraindications. There are no contraindications to giving multiple injections at the same visit and all opportunities to immunize should be utilized. Live viral vaccines given by injection may be either given concomitantly or a minimum interval of 4 weeks apart to address the hypothetical risk of interference from the vaccine given first on the vaccine given later. Generally if two live parenteral vaccines are indicated, it is preferable to them concomitantly to avoid the need for a follow up visit. Concomitant administration of vaccines may be critical when preparing for international travel. Refer to recently administered live viral vaccines.</p>  <p>People may need to be reassured that concomitant administration of most routine vaccines at the same visit does not result in decreased antibody responses or increased rates of adverse reaction. Giving multiple vaccines at one visit helps to ensure that people are up to date with the vaccines required for their age and risk factors.</p>

        <h5>Concern about thimerosol</h5>
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>It is not unusual for people to voice concerns about thimerosol and the effect it can have on brain tissue. Thimerosol is used as a preservative in some vaccines, but not in a dose that would cause safety concerns. If no allergic history is present, there is no legitimate safety reason to avoid the use of thimerosol-containing products, for children or adults, including pregnant women</p>

         <p>Individuals receiving long-term anticoagulation with either warfarin or heparin are not considered to be at higher risk of bleeding complications following immunization and may be safely immunized through either the intramuscular or subcutaneous route (as recommended for the vaccine product)without discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. Give intramuscular administration with a small gauge needle (23 gauge or smaller) and apply firm pressure to the injection site for 5 to 10 minutes. There is a paucity of evidence on whether there is an increased risk of bleeding complications following immunization with the newer types of anticoagulants, such as antiplatelet agents, but there is no reason to believe that they need to be treated any differently from those receiving other anticoagulants.</p>

         <p>Antiviral therapy does not interfere with response to inactivated vaccines or most live vaccines with the following exceptions:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>Varicella vaccine and herpes zoster vaccine may have reduced effectiveness if given concurrently with antivirals active against <em>varicella zoster virus</em> (such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir). People taking long-term antiviral therapy should discontinue these drugs, if possible, from at least 24 hours before administration of varicella or herpes zoster vaccine and should not restart antiviral therapy until 14 days after vaccination.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">LAIV should not be administered until 48 hours after antiviral agents active against influenza (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) are stopped, and antiviral agents should not be administered until at least 14 days after receipt of LAIV unless medically indicated. If antiviral agents are administered within this time frame (from 48 hours before to 14 days after LAIV), revaccination should take place at least 48 hours after the antivirals are stopped.</li>

         <p>Passive immunization with human immune globulin or receipt of most blood products can interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines. Measles-containing or varicella vaccines should be given at least 14 days prior to administration of an immune globulin preparation or blood product, or delayed until the antibodies in the immune globulin preparation or blood product have degraded. A risk-benefit assessment is needed for post-partum women who have received Rh immune globulin (RhIg) and require MMR or varicella vaccine (refer to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations/page-4-immunization-pregnancy-breastfeeding.html">Immunization in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding</a> in Part 3 for additional information).

         <p>It is generally safe to be immunized when taking salicylates (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin, or ASA) although some exceptions apply. LAIV is contraindicated in children and adolescents (2-17 years of age) currently receiving salicylates (e.g. ongoing treatment with aspirin-containing therapy) because of the association of Reye's syndrome with ASA and wild-type influenza infection. TIV is a good alternative. ASA-containing products should be delayed for 4 weeks after receipt of LAIV in children less than 18 years of age.</p>  <p>Another exception is varicella immunization. Varicella-containing vaccine manufacturers recommend avoidance of salicylate therapy for 6 weeks after varicella immunization because of an association between wild-type varicella, salicylate therapy and Reye's syndrome. Health care providers should weigh the theoretical risks associated with varicella vaccine against the known risks associated with wild-type varicella. Because adverse events have not been reported with the use of salicylates after varicella immunization, people with conditions requiring chronic salicylate therapy should be considered for immunization, with close subsequent monitoring.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
         <p>Vaccination provides protection at both an individual and population level. Some people may have conditions that preclude vaccination, but they can be protected by having the people around them vaccinated. Immunization of household contacts of immunosuppressed persons, pregnant women, and neonates provides important protection against transmission of disease in the household.</p>  <p>Up-to-date routine immunizations are recommended for household contacts of pregnant women, immunocompromised persons, and neonates with the following exceptions:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>TIV is preferred over LAIV for those in close contact with severely immunocompromised persons.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">If there are household contacts who have received live, oral polio vaccine in another country within the last 6 weeks, they should not have contact with immunocompromised persons.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">If a vaccine recipient develops a varicella-like rash, the rash should be covered and the vaccinee should avoid direct contact with the immunocompromised person for the duration of the rash</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">Smallpox vaccine should not be administered to household contacts of an immunocompromised person in a non-emergency situation.</li> 
 <li class="mrgn-tp-md">Special precautions should be taken for unvaccinated pregnant household and other close contacts of persons receiving smallpox vaccine in order to eliminate viral transfer to these contacts.</li>
